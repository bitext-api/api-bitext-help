# Intro

This current beta version of Bitext API offers four kinds of text analytics services: sentiment analysis, entity extraction, categorization, and concept extraction. The product is currently available in eight languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, German, Dutch and Catalan. Upcoming versions of the Bitext API will include additional languages and more services, including event extraction.

The Bitext API is extremely intuitive and easy to use. This Quick Start Guide provides a general overview of the Bitext product, including how to set up your account, how to navigate the control panel, how to use Bitext text analysis tools, and how to use Bitext API endpoints in your own code.
